# Instructions  

1. Create a method called _searchMazeMoves_, which takes a 2-D String array as a parameter, that searches a maze to find the minimum number of moves required to go from the start to the finish.  It will return the number of moves as an integer.

The start will always be the bottom left and denoted by an "S".  The finish can be anywhere and will always be denoted by an "F". Walls will be denoted by a "*".  

2. Create a method called _noOfPaths_, which takes a 2-D String array as a parameter, that searches a maze to find how many pathways lead from the start to the finish. It will return the paths as an integer.

The start will always be the bottom left and denoted by an "S".  The finish can be anywhere and will always be denoted by an "F". Walls will be denoted by a "*".
